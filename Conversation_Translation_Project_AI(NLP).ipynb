        "Speaker 2: हाँ, मुझे पता है। लेकिन आप लोग बार-बार फोन करके परेशान कर रहे हैं। मैंने कहा था कि जब पैसे होंगे, मैं भर दूंगा।\n",
        "Speaker 1: देखिए संजयजी, हम आपकी परेशानी समझते हैं। लेकिन आपको भी समझना चाहिए, यह हमारा काम है। क्या आपको पता है कि आपके ऊपर कितना बकाया है?\n",
        "Speaker 2: हाँ-हाँ, मुझे पता है। लगभग 40,000 रुपये होंगे।\n",

        "Speaker 2: तुम धमकी दे रहे हो? तुम्हें पता है मैं कौन हूँ? मैं तुम्हारे खिलाफ शिकायत कर सकता हूँ।\n",
        "Speaker 1: अरे वाह! अब तुम भी धमकी दे रहे हो? चलो, देखते हैं कौन क्या कर सकता है। तुम अपनी पत्नी का इलाज करवाओ, मैं तुम्हारा इलाज करूँगा।\n",
        "Speaker 2: बदतमीज! तुम्हारी हिम्मत कैसे हुई ऐसे बात करने की? मैं तुम्हारे बॉस से शिकायत करूँगा।\n",
        "Speaker 1: करो जो करना है। लेकिन याद रखना, अगर कल तक पैसे नहीं आए तो मैं खुद तुम्हारे घर आऊंगा। और तब देखेंगे कौन किसका इलाज करता है।\n",
        "Speaker 2: तुम मेरे घर आओगे? ठीक है, आ जाओ। मैं पुलिस को बुला लूंगा।\n",
        "Speaker 1: अरे वाह! पुलिस? बहुत अच्छा। हम भी देखेंगे कि पुलिस किसका साथ देती है - एक कर्जदार का या एक कानूनी कंपनी का।\n",
